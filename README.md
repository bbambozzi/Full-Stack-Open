# [Full Stack Open] Course Completion
I am proud to announce that I have completed the [Full Stack Open] course offered by the [University of Helsinki]. This is a rigorous and comprehensive course that covers a wide range of modern web development technologies, including React, Redux, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript, Cloud Hosting, SQL Databases and Docker Containers.

Throughout the course, I gained a deep understanding of these technologies and was able to apply them in real-world projects. I worked on several exercises and projects that required me to build complex web applications from scratch. By the end of the course, I was able to build full-stack applications that were responsive, user-friendly, and scalable.
