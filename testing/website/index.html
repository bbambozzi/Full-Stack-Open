<h1 class="sonnet-18-title">Sonnet 18</h1>
<p class="sonnet-18">Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:<br>
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
    And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed:<br>
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
    Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade<br>
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:<br>
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
